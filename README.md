# Introduction
This repository shall describe all necessary steps, in order to encrypt the `root partition` of the Raspberry Pi stock image `Raspberry Pi OS Lite`.

The instructions are adaptable for `other Raspberry Pi revisions` as well. They should also work on `image files with partition information` in general.

# Selecting the target distribution
Please refer to the different branches for your `target distribution`:
* [`Debian 10 (Buster)`](https://codeberg.org/keks24/raspberry-pi-luks/src/branch/debian_10_buster) on a `Raspberry Pi Model B Rev 2`.
* [`Debian 12 (Bookworm)`](https://codeberg.org/keks24/raspberry-pi-luks/src/branch/debian_12_bookworm) on a `Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.4`.
